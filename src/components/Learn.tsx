          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Founded in 2023, Manavata was born out of a deep desire to bring hope, dignity, and support to those most in
            need — abused children, orphans, widows, and the marginalized. With a vision to create a sustainable and
            impactful charitable organization, Manavata is built on the pillars of integrity, empathy, professionalism,
            and inclusivity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            We are driven by a simple but powerful mission: To efficiently and effectively reach out to the vulnerable
            and provide meaningful support.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            At Manavata, every action is rooted in understanding — understanding the pain of a child left alone, the
            silence of a grieving widow, and the silent struggles of the abandoned. Our team is committed to walking
            alongside these individuals, offering not just aid, but dignity, respect, and opportunity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            What makes Manavata unique? Our values. From transparent operations to inclusive programs, we prioritize
            ethics, collaboration, and quality service. Our team is not only professionally equipped but also
            emotionally aligned with our mission, ensuring our work goes beyond charity — it touches lives.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            We believe in diversity, open communication, and delivering services that meet international standards,
            ensuring that every person we reach is treated with care and fairness. As we grow, we continue to adapt,
            innovate, and stay accountable — not just to our mission, but to every life that depends on it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
            Manavata is more than an NGO. It's a movement. A promise. A foundation for succour.
